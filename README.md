# Distributed Federated Learning Protocols
An ERC-20 token accesses federated learning protocols on-chain for systems to train algorithm models on users personal health records that professionals embed into updated models of health care practice. Pateints directly push-pull local model updates and determine participation in advance as part of a bidding process without any intermediary — as per BAFFLE framework. Surplas of economic exchange (i.e. gas fees and token reward) are determined in advance before participation in a given round is finalised. Token transactions are passed directly into users’ digital wallets to fund access to healthcare provision with a roadmap to developing cryptographic-based insurance solutions. A long-term roadmap seeks to remove entry barrier-thresholds to healthcare access and lays the foundations for universal coverage that would not, for example, rely on government subsidy.
