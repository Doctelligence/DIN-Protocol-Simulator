# Distributed Federated Learning Protocols
An ERC-20 token accesses federated learning protocols on a public blockchain for systems to train algorithm models on users personal health records. Pateints directly push-pull local model updates and determine participation in advance as part of a bidding process without any intermediary — as per BAFFLE framework https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07452. Surplas of economic exchange (i.e. gas fees and token reward) are determined in advance before participation in a given round is finalised and this process is automated. Token transactions are passed directly into users’ digital wallets to fund access to healthcare provision with a roadmap to developing decentralized cryptographic-based insurance solutions. A long-term roadmap seeks to remove entry barrier-thresholds to healthcare access and lays the foundations for universal coverage that would not, for example, rely on government subsidy.

A "Data-Partion Script" allows you to experiment with a #1 a different number of patients #2 a different number of data-points per patient to mimic their personal health records.
