CC-19 Dataset 

The data set contains the Computed Tomography scan (CT) slices for 89 subjects. 
Out of these 89 subjects, 68 were confirmed patients (positive cases) of the COVID-19 virus, and the rest 21 were found to be negative cases.
The proposed dataset “CC-19” contains 34,006 CT scan slices (images) belonging to 98 subjects out of which 28,395 CT scan slices belong to positive COVID patients.
The dataset is made publically available. 
CT scanning devices are carefully calibrated to measure the HU units. This unit can be employed to extract the relevant information in CT Scan slices.
The CT scan slices have cylindrical scanning bounds. 
For unknown reasons, the pixel information outside this cylindrical bound was automatically discarded by the CT scanner system.This discarding of outer pixels eliminates some steps for preprocessing.
